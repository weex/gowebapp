# gowebapp

Simplistic Go Web App

Read about it [here](https://grisha.org/blog/2017/04/27/simplistic-go-web-app/).




To install:

1. You need PostgreSQL, install it somehow, make an empty database
   called `gowebapp`. (Usually `createdb gowebapp` on the command line is
   all you need).

1. You need Go, preferably the latest version (1.8).

1. Now do this:

```
$ export GOPATH=~/go # optional, adjust as necessary
$ go get github.com/grisha/gowebapp
```

1. That's it. You should now be able to run:
```
$ $GOPATH/bin/gowebapp
```
